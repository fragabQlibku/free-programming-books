## How to Use Canon Service Tool to Reset Your Printer
  
After downloading and installing Canon Service Tool on your computer, you can use it to reset your printer. However, before you do that, you need to put your printer in "Service Mode". This mode allows you to access the service functions of your printer and perform the reset process. The method of entering Service Mode varies depending on your printer model, so please refer to your printer manual or search online for the specific steps.
  
Once your printer is in Service Mode, follow these steps to use Canon Service Tool:

1. Connect your printer to your computer using a USB cable.
2. Open Canon Service Tool and select your printer model from the drop-down menu.
3. Load two sheets of paper in the printer tray.
4. Click on "Set" on the "Absorber" row. This will clear the ink counter and reset the ink absorber pad.
5. The printer will print one sheet of document. If a confirmation window appears, click "OK".
6. Click on "EEPROM". This will print the EEPROM information of your printer, such as serial number, destination region, etc.
7. The printer will print another sheet of document. If a confirmation window appears, click "OK".
8. Compare the results of the EEPROM information before and after the reset. If they are different, then the reset was successful.
9. Close Canon Service Tool and turn off your printer.
10. Wait for 10 seconds and turn on your printer again.

Your printer should now be able to print normally again. If you encounter any problems or errors during or after the reset process, please contact Canon Support for further assistance.
