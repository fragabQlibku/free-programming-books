TomTom is one of the most popular and reliable navigation software in the world. It offers many features and benefits, such as:

- High-quality maps that cover over 150 countries and regions.
- Real-time traffic information and speed camera alerts.
- Advanced lane guidance and junction view.
- Voice control and hands-free calling.
- Personalized routes and destinations.
- Online services and updates via Wi-Fi or cellular network.

However, TomTom is not compatible with all devices and platforms. Some devices, such as those with Windows CE operating system, may not support TomTom natively. Windows CE is a lightweight and embedded version of Windows that is used by many portable and industrial devices, such as GPS navigators, PDAs, scanners, and terminals. Windows CE devices usually have limited hardware resources and functionality compared to other platforms.
 
Fortunately, there is a way to run TomTom on Windows CE devices using a ready-made package called "gotowiec". A gotowiec is a pre-configured package that contains TomTom software and maps for a specific device and region. It is usually created by users who share their customizations and settings with others. A gotowiec can save you time and hassle of configuring TomTom manually on your Windows CE device.
