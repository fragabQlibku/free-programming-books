# 3D Inescop Footwear Software: A Revolutionary Solution for Footwear Design and Manufacturing
 
Footwear design and manufacturing is a complex and challenging process that requires creativity, precision, and efficiency. Traditional methods of footwear design and pattern engineering involve drawing on paper or real lasts, flattening the designs manually, and cutting the materials by hand or machine. These methods are time-consuming, costly, and prone to errors.
 
Fortunately, there is a better way to design and produce footwear: 3D Inescop Footwear Software. This software is the first of its kind that integrates two working environments into a single program: virtual 3D and technical 2D, which operate simultaneously. This software allows footwear designers and manufacturers to create any type of footwear model in 3D, apply materials and accessories, obtain accurate 2D patterns, and export them to different formats for production.

3D Inescop Footwear Software is developed by INESCOP (Centre for Technology and Innovation), a world leader in the development of computer-aided footwear design systems with more than 2,000 installations in 39 countries. INESCOP has more than 30 years of experience in providing software solutions and services for the footwear industry.
 
Some of the features and benefits of 3D Inescop Footwear Software are:
 
- It allows the import and preparation of digital lasts in a wide range of formats (HOR, LST, STL, IGS, SEC, OBJ, etc).
- It flattens any last shape, including boots and ankle boots, in a totally accurate and reliable way.
- It enables drawing directly on the digital last with simple tools, using sketches or images as reference.
- It creates quickly and easily any type of sole (sports, platforms, wedges, etc.) and heels.
- It generates all the pieces of the model by selecting the sequence of lines or by clicking on a point inside the piece.
- It allows the creation and application of accessories of any shape, material, and complexity (laces, zippers, buckles, etc.).
- It offers a wide variety of materials (leather, rubber, patent leather, metal, gems, crystal, etc.) in any color that can be applied on any part of the model by a simple click.
- It integrates an advanced high-quality rendering system that produces hyper-realistic images and videos of the footwear models.
- It reduces costs in human resources and materials by speeding up the design and pattern engineering process.

3D Inescop Footwear Software is not only a powerful tool for footwear design and pattern engineering, but also a versatile solution that can be integrated with other software and hardware applications for footwear and insole manufacturing. Some of these applications are:

- 3D Last Design and Manufacturing: This software allows the creation and editing of digital lasts from real lasts previously digitized, using 2D and 3D tools. The digital lasts can be exported to different formats for 3D printing or CNC machining.
- Footwear Sole Design and Manufacturing: This software enables the intuitive and simple creation of the different sole elements from a digitized last and through reverse engineering. A complex outsole can be designed to be printed in 3D.
- 3D Anatomic Insole Design: This software automates the tasks that are usually performed manually by podiatrists, from insole design to manufacturing. It allows the customization of insoles according to the foot shape, pathology, and pressure distribution.
- Footwear Configurator: This software allows the 3D and web-based display of footwear models, as well as the possibility of combining different materials, colors, and textures, in an instantaneous and simple way. It can be used for online sales, virtual fitting, or customer feedback.

3D Inescop Footwear Software is also compatible with various hardware devices that facilitate the digitization and production of footwear and insoles. These devices include:

- 3D Foot Scanner: This device allows a fast and accurate foot digitization. Thanks to the advanced vision system, a noiseless and open working environment is achieved.
- 3D Last Scanner: This device allows last digitization with no supports (toe-end and heel) thanks to the support holding the last on its top cone surface.
- 3D Foot Sole Scanner: This portable scanner is suitable for digitization and post-reconstruction of the bottom part of the foot.
- YourFeet App: This app for mobile devices allows you to obtain your foot length and width measures, as well as your shoe size expressed in different international sizing systems.

With 3D Inescop Footwear Software, you can take your footwear design and manufacturing to the next level. You can create stunning footwear models in 3D, obtain precise 2D patterns, and produce them with high quality and efficiency. You can also integrate your software with other applications and devices that enhance your productivity and competitiveness. Don't miss this opportunity to join the revolution of 3D footwear design and manufacturing.
