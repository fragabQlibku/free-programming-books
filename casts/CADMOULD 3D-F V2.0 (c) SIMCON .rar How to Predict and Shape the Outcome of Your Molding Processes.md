# What is CADMOULD 3D-F V2.0 and why you should use it for plastic injection molding simulation
 
CADMOULD 3D-F V2.0 is a professional software product developed by SIMCON, a German company specialized in plastic injection molding simulation. CADMOULD 3D-F V2.0 uses the highly precise 3D-F method, which was especially developed for injection molding simulation, making it a superior simulation solution.
 
With CADMOULD 3D-F V2.0, you can predict and optimize what will happen inside the mold, from filling, through packing, to cooling, shrinkage and warpage. You can test different materials and modified part designs virtually, without wasting material, machine utilization and engineering hours, before you build your mold. You can also anticipate and fix issues before they happen, such as filling issues like air entrapments and weld lines, or shrinkage and warpage issues. Moreover, you can improve cycle times, energy use, reduce material waste and improve your sustainability footprint.

If you want to learn more about CADMOULD 3D-F V2.0 and how it can help you improve your injection molding designs, you can download a free trial version from SIMCON's website[^1^] or contact them for a free consultation[^1^]. You can also watch some videos of CADMOULD 3D-F V2.0 in action on their YouTube channel.
  
CADMOULD 3D-F V2.0 is not only a powerful simulation tool, but also a collaborative platform that allows you to share and visualize your results with your colleagues from other departments. By using CADMOULD 3D-F V2.0, you can enhance the communication and understanding between part and mold engineers, machine setters and measurement technicians. You can also export your results to various formats, such as PDF, Excel or PowerPoint, for easy reporting and presentation.
 
CADMOULD 3D-F V2.0 also offers a superior multi-sim performance, thanks to its sophisticated simulation algorithms that are optimized to run multiple simulations in parallel. If you have a powerful multi-core CPU computer, you can run several simulations concurrently, on the same computer. This way, you can learn more, faster, and simulate multiple variants in hours instead of days.
 
CADMOULD 3D-F V2.0 is the ultimate software solution for plastic injection molding simulation. It can help you reduce mold corrections, shorten time-to-market, improve product quality and efficiency, and save costs and resources. If you want to experience the benefits of CADMOULD 3D-F V2.0 for yourself, don't hesitate to download the free trial version or contact SIMCON for a free consultation today.
