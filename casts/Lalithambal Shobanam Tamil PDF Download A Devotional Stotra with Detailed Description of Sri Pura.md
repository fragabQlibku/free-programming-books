The poem tells how the devas were troubled by two asuras named Daruka and Soora, who had a boon that they could only be killed by a son of Shiva. At that time, Shiva's wife Sati had died and he was doing penance. Sati was reborn as the daughter of Himalaya Mountain. The devas requested Manmatha, the god of love, to shoot an arrow at Shiva to make him fall in love with Sati again. But Shiva woke up, opened his third eye and burnt Manmatha to ashes. Later, Viswakarma, the divine architect, made a doll out of the ashes of Manmatha. Shiva gave him life and many boons. Brahma named him Banda. Banda became an evil king and waged war against the devas.
 
The devas realized that only the Goddess who would marry Shiva could kill Banda. They prayed to the supreme mother and she appeared as Lalitha Devi, the playful and easily pleased Goddess. She married Kameswara, the handsome form of Shiva, and led a huge army to fight against Banda. She killed him and his followers with her weapons and powers. She also revived Manmatha from his ashes and reunited him with his wife Rati. She then ruled over Sri Pura, her divine city, with Kameswara.
